                comment: 'This is a great course if you want to become a Java Developer. It packs a lot of content based on the course instructors "years of work experience". It prepares you for a developer role i.e. you learn java principles, you practice with assignments, and you become a master at googling stuff (Augmenting your knowledge). You get answers to questions from the teaching assistants within 48 hours. It is not designed or delivered as a college/university course; it s very hands-on! In addition it s not perfect but it does what it says on the tin (excuse the pun). Looking forward to the course remaster ?',

The reason I made this course is because there is a huge gap for many students between machine learning ""theory"" and writing actual code. As I ve always said "If you canot implement it then you donot understand it".Without the basic knowledge of data manipulation This course closes that gap by teaching you all the basic operations you need for implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms.The goal is after you take this course you will learn about machine learning algorithms and implement those algorithms in code using the tools and techniques you learned in this course.Suggested Prerequisites:linear algebra probability Python programming"  ',
